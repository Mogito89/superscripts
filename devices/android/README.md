# Taps and swipes

This allows you to enable taps and swipes on your Android phone.

Just run for example:

* source menu_down.tap

I have a Nexus 7. You will have to adjust the dimensions to your phone accordingly. Of course, your phone has to be connected over USB.

For more information:

* adb shell input
